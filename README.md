# The Number Library
The Number Library is a project I started because Google Search (and other search engines) struggle with finding irrational numbers.

Feel free to open issues for new irrational numbers, giving rapidly convergent formulas for said constants. An example is the Chudnovskys' formula for $\pi$ and the infinite sum for $e$. I know the former to stop in 37 iterations.

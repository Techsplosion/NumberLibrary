$\mathrm{log}_{2}(3)$ - Base-2 logarithm of 3. Fractal dimension of the Sierpiński triangle.

$\mathrm{ln}(2)$ - Natural logarithm of 2.

$W(1)$ - More specifically $W_{0}(1)$. Product-logarithm of 1. Number $z$ such that $ze^z$ = 1.

$\sqrt{2}$ - Square-root of 2. Hypotenuse of a right triangle with adjacent and opposite of length 1. [Hippasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippasus) is said to be [drowned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippasus#Doctrines) over this constant. Called the radical.

$\sqrt{3}$ - Square-root of 3. Called Thedorus' constant. Twice the ratio of an equilateral triangle's height to its sidelength.

$e$ - Euler's number. The name $e$ is purely coincidental and has nothing to do with Euler. Some formulas and properties relating to $e$ are:
$$
\begin{align}
e^{x}&=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{k}}{k!}\\
e&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n}\\
\frac{d}{dx}e^{x}&=e^{x}
\end{align}
$$

$\pi$ - Pi. Comes from the Greek word *perimetros* meaning perimeter or circumference. The constant ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Some formulas are:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi&=\int_{-1}^{1}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}\\
\pi&=\sqrt{6\zeta(2)}\\
\pi&=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{dx}{1+x^{2}}
\end{align}
$$

$\varphi$ - The golden ratio. It is:
* the limiting ratio between to consecutive Fibonacci numbers
* claimed to be the most irrational number
* claimed to be the ratio between the edge lengths of the most beautiful rectangle
* ironically irrational
* the positive solution to $z^{2}=z+1$

$\zeta(2)$ - Exactly equal to $\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}$.

$\zeta(3)$ - Apéry's constant. It is known to be irrational but it is unknown whether it is transcendental.

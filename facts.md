$\mathrm{log}_{2}(3)$ - Base-2 logarithm of 3. Fractal dimension of the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle.
$\mathrm{ln}(2)$ - Natural logarithm of 2.
$W(1)$ - More specifically $W_{0}(1)$. Product-logarithm of 1. Number $z$ such that $ze^z$ = 1.
$\sqrt{2}$ - Square-root of 2. Hypotenuse of a right triangle with adjacent and opposite of length 1. [Hippasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippasus) is said to be [drowned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippasus#Doctrines) over this constant. Called the radical.
$\sqrt{3}$ - Square-root of 3. Called Thedorus' constant. Twice the ratio of an equilateral triangle's height to its sidelength.
$e$ - Euler's number. The name $e$ is purely coincidental and has nothing to do with Euler. Some formulas and properties relating to $e$ are:
$$
\begin{align}
e^{x}&=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{k}}{k!}\\
e&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n}\\
\frac{d}{dx}e^{x}&=e^{x}
\end{align}
